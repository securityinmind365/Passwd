# What is passwd file?

This a file that stores essential information, which is required during login. In other words, it stores user account information. The /etc/passwd is a plain text file. It contains a list of the systemâ€™s accounts, giving for each account some useful information like user ID, group ID, home directory, shell, and more. The /etc/passwd file should have general read permission as many command utilities use it to map user IDs to user names. However, write access to the /etc/passwd must only limit for the superuser/root account.
